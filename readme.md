# Ollama Tool Use examples

I was able to try out ollama's latest tool use abilities

This project uses `vite` and `Ollama v0.3.0` 

The model we use is `llama3.1`

Clone the repo and do 

```bash
npm install # inside the directory
npm run dev # after install is complete
# UI will appear on localhost with a link in the terminal
```

### What can it do

- Run local code blocks
    - Get current date and time
- Run fetch to get data from external links
- Run fetch to toggle a simple server lamp running on a [NodeMCU](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B010O1G1ES)
